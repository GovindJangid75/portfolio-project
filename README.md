🚀 Project Title & Tagline
==========================
**Govind Jangid - Portfolio** 📄
*A showcase of skills and experiences, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*

📖 Description
---------------

This project is a static website designed to showcase the skills and experiences of Govind Jangid. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. The website includes several sections, such as a home page, about page, and contact page, each with its own unique content and design.

The website is designed to be easy to navigate, with a simple and intuitive menu system that allows users to quickly access different sections of the website. The website also features a number of interactive elements, such as animations and scrolling effects, that enhance the user experience and make the website more engaging.

One of the key goals of this project was to create a website that is both visually appealing and highly functional. To achieve this, we used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a website that is both responsive and interactive. We also used a number of different tools and technologies, such as CSS variables and JavaScript libraries, to make the website more efficient and easier to maintain.

For example, we used CSS variables to define a set of colors and fonts that are used throughout the website. This makes it easy to update the website's design by simply changing the values of these variables. We also used JavaScript libraries, such as AOS (Animate On Scroll), to add animations and scrolling effects to the website.

Here is an example of how we used CSS variables to define the website's colors:
```css
:root {
  /* Colors */
  --primary-50: #fff7ed;
  --primary-100: #ffedd5;
  --primary-200: #fed7aa;
  --primary-300: #fdba74;
  --primary-400: #fb923c;
}
```
And here is an example of how we used JavaScript to add animations to the website:
```javascript
// Initialize AOS (Animate On Scroll)
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    AOS.init({
        duration: 800,
        easing: 'ease-in-out',
        once: true,
        mirror: false
    });
```
